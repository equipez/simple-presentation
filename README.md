# Simple presentation

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/equipez/simple-presentation/build.yml?logo=github&style=for-the-badge)

## Getting ready

To use this template, simply modify the file `main.tex` to include whatever you want.
You can also rename it if necessary.
The compilation necessitates latexmk v4.51 or higher, included by default in recent texlive distributions.

## Important notes

All the files `*.tex` in the root folder are attempted to be compiled as LaTeX root files.
Therefore, if you split your presentation into several documents, create a folder (e.g., `content/`) and place your secondary LaTeX files in it.
